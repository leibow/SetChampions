Protocol

Client: 

Client sees screen and chooses to either login or register.
On Both Login & Register: He sends user/pass to server, and waits for yes/no response.

Now, he is logged in, and is entered into the game with 0 gamepoints(gp), and a certain amount of userpoints (up), based on his history.
Here's the problem.
The player needs to listen for new boards, but he also needs to be able to send a move as well. How do you do this in code. What function listens while also waiting. 
Some type of event listener...
Don't really want two sockets because thats clunky. Requiring the player to open two sockets when he connects in.....


Server:
Server exists for a single game, for the time being.
Client connects and server opens up a playerserver. This playerserver reads the username and password and either checks the db or inserts.
It updates his last logged in time. 
Now, it will send him the board message.

  
Board Message = Board.toString() + List of All Players with their point values.

	Player <-> Server
Socket 1 =
	Move   <-> 
Socket 2 =
	       <-> Board + Player List with Point Values
