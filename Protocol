Protocol

Client: 

Client sees screen and chooses to either login or register.
On Both Login & Register: He sends user/pass to server, and waits for yes/no response.

Now, he is logged in, and is entered into the game with 0 gamepoints(gp), and a certain amount of userpoints (up), based on his history.





Server:
Server exists for a single game, for the time being.
Client connects and server opens up a playerserver. This playerserver reads the username and password and either checks the db or inserts.
It updates his last logged in time. 
Now, it will send him his board, and wait to hear a move.
It will also open up another socket with him, 




	Player <-> Server
Socket 1 =
	Move   <-> 
Socket 2 =
	       <-> Board + Player List with Point Values
